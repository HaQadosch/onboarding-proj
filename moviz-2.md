# Moviz 2, back with a vengeance

This is a follow up to the project _Moviz_.

* Using React Router,
* The landing page redirets to `/moviz`.
* There is a Link/Icon at the top of all pages that redirects to `/moviz`
* The page `/moviz` list the top 10 recommendations of the week and filter exactly like in the _Moviz_ project.
* When I click a movie for more details, I am redirected to the page `/movi/movi-id`
* The page `/movi/movi-id` details the movi movi-id along with 
  * the highest recommanded movie
  * the lowest recommended one
